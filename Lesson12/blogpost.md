## what was challenging

When we started, we thought this task would be very difficult. It seemed like there were a lot of uncertainties for how to do things like stitching the trace back into the program, especially in the middle of a basic block (and even worse for a function). In the end, we scoped the tracing/stitching in a way that made it very straightforward.
